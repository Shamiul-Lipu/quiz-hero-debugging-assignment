                    <span class="font-semibold">.map()</span>, executes the same code on every element in an array and
                    returns a new array with the updated elements.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">.forEach()</span>, is used to execute the same code on every element in
                    an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">.filter()</span>, checks every element in an array to see if it meets a
                    certain condition and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">.find()</span>, returns only one match in an array. If in an array is

                    <span class="font-semibold">Local Storage</span> allows amounts of data to be stored with no
                    expiration date.
                    but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data
                    that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Session Storage</span> is session-based and works per window or tab.
                    This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session until the browser (or tab) is
                    closed.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Cookiese</span> store small amounts of data that has to be sent
                    back to the server with subsequent requests and their expiration can be set from either server or
                    client. They are primarily used for server-side reading.Cookies expire based on the setting and

                </h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- answer -->
                    JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one
                    thing at a single point in time but javaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
                    responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued
                    sub-tasks.The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading.
                    <br>
                    The Event Loop — has to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it.The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the
                    operations in line to be executed.
                    Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.The event queue is responsible for
                    sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                    execution.Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built
                    into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
                    single-threaded operation. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as
                    separate threads.
                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                    empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                    function call is processed.

                    quizTimer function handle timer of the whole quiz. quizeTimer using conditional rendaring and
                    initially its value sets true and call the
                    clearInterval() which is because of quizTimer initial value sets as dismiss is ture. The quizeTimer
                    first called from eventListener startQuiz and called value as undefined so the quizeTimer's starts
                    the setInterval and count the time until the quizeTimer called again sets it's value to true(dismiss
                    true and clearInterval call to stop the timer) from eventListener submit .

                    options for the displayed quiz. dynamically it takes the index and given answer from the
                    user and checks the answers from the global variable answers array using find method. then using
                    condition on existing id and quiz data it either splice or push the quiz data to the answers array.
                    And
                    finally calles displayAnswers(answers) to display the given answered from the user.
